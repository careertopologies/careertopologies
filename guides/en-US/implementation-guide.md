## Success Metrics

### Implementation Metrics
- [ ] % of professionals mapped to levels
- [ ] % of trained managers
- [ ] % of complete documentation

### Impact Metrics (6-12 months post-rollout)
- [ ] Retention rate (target: improvement of X%)
- [ ] Satisfaction with career clarity (survey)
- [ ] Perception of promotion fairness (survey)
- [ ] Diversity in senior levels (% of underrepresented groups)
- [ ] Average time to promotion (per level)
- [ ] % of internal promotions vs. external hires

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Leadership Resistance
**Mitigation**: Involve leaders from diagnosis phase, show ROI (retention, productivity)

### Risk 2: Excessive Complexity
**Mitigation**: Start simple (basic levels + minimal processes), add complexity gradually

### Risk 3: Unrealistic Expectations
**Mitigation**: Clearly communicate that not everyone will be promoted immediately, focus on fair process

### Risk 4: Lack of Budget for Adjustments
**Mitigation**: Plan adjustments in phases, prioritize equity corrections first

### Risk 5: Inconsistent Adoption by Managers
**Mitigation**: Robust training, regular calibrations, consequences for non-adoption
