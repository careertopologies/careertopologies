## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Principle of Clarity
> **"If expectations are not clear, evolution is not fair."**

### 2. Principle of Consistency
> **"Same criteria, same opportunities, for all people."**

### 3. Principle of Impact > Time
> **"Recognize results and impact, not just tenure."**

### 4. Principle of Sustainability
> **"Career growth should be sustainable, not a sprint."**

### 5. Principle of Flexibility
> **"Careers are not linear; allow horizontal movements and track changes."**

## Career Progression Laws

### Organizational Conway's Law
> **"Career structure reflects organizational structure."**

### Career Parkinson's Law
> **"Expectations expand to fill available time."**

### Performance Goodhart's Law
> **"When a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric."**

### Invisible Glass Ceiling Law
> **"Without representation at senior levels, minorities face invisible barriers."**

### Peter Principle
