# Professional Shapes: Breadth vs. Depth

[![Back](https://img.shields.io/badge/BACK-documentation-blue?style=for-the-badge)](./README.md)

## What are Professional Shapes?

Professional "shapes" describe the **distribution of skills and knowledge** of a professional throughout their career. They visually represent the balance between:

- **Depth (vertical)**: Deep expertise in specific domains
- **Breadth (horizontal)**: Broad knowledge across related areas

### Why Do Shapes Matter?

Shapes complement career levels and topologies:

- **Don't indicate seniority**: A junior can be I-shaped and so can a senior (in different contexts)
- **Describe skill distribution**: How your knowledge is structured
- **Guide development**: Help plan next career steps
- **Inform allocation**: Assist in choosing projects and responsibilities

### Natural Evolution: I → T → Pi

Most professionals evolve throughout their career:

1. **I-shaped (beginning)**: Building first depth
2. **T-shaped (middle)**: Adding breadth after mastering base
3. **Pi-shaped (advanced)**: Developing second depth

**Important**: There is no single "ideal" shape. Each company and area should value the profiles that best fit their challenges. Shapes should not be imposed, but used to align expectations between professionals and organizations.

## I-Shaped Profile: Deep Specialist

<div align="center">
<img src="../../assets/careertopologies-shapes-i.png" alt="I-Shaped Profile" width="400">
</div>

### Description

- **Deep expertise in single domain** or technology
- **Narrow but profound knowledge**
- Typical **early in career** or in **highly specialized roles**
- Visually represented by a **single vertical line** (depth in one area)

### Strengths

**Mastery of specific domain**: Recognized expert in their area  
**Go-to for complex problems**: Reference person for difficult specialty questions  
**Deep technical credibility**: Authority on the subject

### Challenges

**Limited versatility**: Difficulty acting outside main domain  
**Cross-domain collaboration**: May struggle working with other areas  
**Career mobility**: Opportunities may be restricted to specific contexts

### Examples

- Database specialist focused only on PostgreSQL
- Security researcher in specific vulnerability class
- Algorithm expert in specific optimization domain
- .NET developer focused exclusively on backend
- UI designer specialized only in design systems

### When It Works Well

**Highly specialized roles**: Research, deep technical work  
**Organizations with clear domain boundaries**: Traditional functional structures  
**Early career**: While building foundational expertise  
**Deep tech contexts**: Areas requiring years of focused study

### Recommendation

I-shaped specialists work best in:
- Functional teams (e.g., infra team, security team)
- Centers of excellence
- Research and development roles

In product teams or value streams (agile squads), the I-shaped model may **not scale well** due to the high number of professionals needed for end-to-end deliveries.

## T-Shaped Profile: Deep + Broad

<div align="center">
<img src="../../assets/careertopologies-shapes-t.png" alt="T-Shaped Profile" width="400">
</div>

### Description

- **Deep expertise in one domain** (vertical line of the T)
- **Broad knowledge across related domains** (horizontal line of the T)
- **Most common profile for senior ICs**
- Visually represented by a **T** (vertical depth + horizontal breadth)

### Strengths

**Cross-functional leadership**: Can lead projects requiring understanding of multiple areas  
**Effective collaborator**: Works well with diverse teams  
**Translator between specialists**: Bridges different domains  
**Versatility and adaptability**: Can act in varied contexts

### Challenges

**Time to build breadth**: Requires years after building depth  
**Risk of superficiality**: Can become "jack of all trades, master of one"  
**Skill maintenance**: Breadth must be constantly practiced (skills decay)

### Examples

- **Backend engineer** (deep) with frontend, infra, and product knowledge (broad)
- **Data scientist** (deep) with engineering, business, and visualization skills (broad)
- **Product manager** (deep) with fluency in design, engineering, and marketing (broad)
- **Software engineer** generalist with specialization in one stack
- **Product designer** with UX expertise and UI, research, front-end knowledge

### When It Works Well

**Senior IC roles**: Requiring cross-functional leadership  
**Tech Lead positions**: Technical leadership without formal management  
**Organizations valuing collaboration**: Agile and multidisciplinary team cultures  
**Product squads**: Teams delivering end-to-end features

### Recommendation

In **agile and lean organizations**, T-shaped professionals are highly suitable due to:
- Flexibility to act on different fronts
- Ability to collaborate with specialists from other areas
- Contribution to team integration and efficiency
- Reduction of handoffs and silos

## Pi-Shaped Profile: Two Deep Domains

<div align="center">
<img src="../../assets/careertopologies-shapes-pi.png" alt="Pi-Shaped Profile" width="400">
</div>

### Description

- **Deep expertise in TWO distinct domains** (two vertical lines of π)
- **Broad knowledge across other areas** (horizontal line of π)
- **Rare and highly valuable** for bridging specialties
- Visually represented by a **π** (Greek Pi): two verticals + horizontal

### Strengths

**Bridge between domains**: Connects traditionally separate areas  
**Cross-domain innovation**: Creates innovative solutions from multiple area insights  
**Highly versatile and valuable**: Scarce profile in the market  
**Leadership of complex initiatives**: Can lead multidisciplinary projects

### Challenges

**Takes years to develop**: Two depths + breadth requires 10-15+ years  
**Risk of splitting focus**: May not achieve true depth in either area  
**Requires intentional planning**: Doesn't happen by accident, needs conscious strategy

### Examples

- **Engineer + Product Manager**: Technical depth + product depth
- **Data Scientist + Software Engineer**: ML depth + engineering depth
- **Designer + Engineer**: Design depth + technical depth
- **Security Expert + Infrastructure Expert**: Two complementary technical specialties
- **Distinguished Engineer**: Multiple technical specialties + leadership

### When It Works Well

**Staff+ IC roles**: Highest levels of individual contribution  
**Tech Lead or Principal Engineer positions**: Senior technical leadership  
**Startups or innovative environments**: Requiring extreme versatility  
**Bridging organizational silos**: Connecting traditionally separate areas

### Recommendation

Pi-shaped people are **rare and extremely valuable**. They can:
- Be allocated in broad and complex contexts
- Offer strategic support to multiple teams
- Lead initiatives that cross organizational boundaries
- Act as "glue" in large organizations

## How Shapes Map to Career Levels

Shape evolution is directly related to progression levels:

| Career Level | Typical Shape | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Junior ICs (Levels 1-2)** | I-shaped | Building first depth |
| **Mid ICs (Levels 3-4)** | I → T | Transition: adding breadth |
| **Senior ICs (Levels 5-6)** | Solid T-shaped | Depth + breadth established |
| **Staff+ ICs (Levels 7-8)** | Pi-shaped | Two depths + breadth (increasing value) |
| **Management Track** | T or Pi | Almost required (must understand multiple domains) |
| **Tech Lead (W-Model)** | Pi ideal | Technical depth + leadership depth |

### Observations

- **Junior I-shaped is expected**: Focus is building solid foundation
- **Senior requires T-shaped**: Collaboration and technical leadership demand breadth
- **Staff+ values Pi**: Cross-functional impact and complex initiative leadership
- **Managers need T or Pi**: Impossible to lead without understanding team domains
