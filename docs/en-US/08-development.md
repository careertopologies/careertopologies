## Development Principles

### 1. Individual Ownership
The professional is the **main responsible** for their development.

### 2. Shared Responsibility
Managers and organization must provide support, resources, and opportunities.

### 3. Continuous Development
Learning is **continuous and incremental**: 70% practical, 20% social, 10% formal.

### 4. Focus on Impact
Development should result in **measurable impact**.

## Development Tools

## Formal Processes
