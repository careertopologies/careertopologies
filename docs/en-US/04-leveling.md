# Career Leveling

[![Back](https://img.shields.io/badge/BACK-documentation-blue?style=for-the-badge)](./README.md)

Career leveling is one of the fundamental pillars of the Career Topologies framework. It defines objective criteria to distinguish different stages of professional development, based on two main dimensions: **Impact** and **Autonomy**.

## The Impact × Autonomy Framework

### Impact Dimension

The impact dimension defines the **reach and scope** of your contributions within the organization:

- **Individual**: Your deliverables primarily affect your own work
- **Team**: Your contributions impact the entire team
- **Department**: Your work influences multiple teams or an entire department
- **Organization**: Your decisions and deliverables affect the company as a whole
- **Ecosystem**: Your impact transcends the organization, influencing the market/community

### Autonomy Dimension

The autonomy dimension defines the **degree of independence** in decision-making and work execution:

- **Guided**: Works with close supervision and frequent direction
- **Independent**: Executes work autonomously within their scope
- **Leading**: Guides others and defines approaches for teams/projects
- **Defining**: Establishes strategic directions and organizational standards

## Level Structure

### Entry Level
**Intern / Associate** - Impact: Individual | Autonomy: Guided

### Base Level
**Junior** - Impact: Individual → Team | Autonomy: Guided → Independent  
**Mid-Level** - Impact: Team | Autonomy: Independent  
**Senior** - Impact: Team → Department | Autonomy: Independent → Leading

### Specialized Level
**Staff / Specialist** - Impact: Department | Autonomy: Leading  
**Principal** - Impact: Organization | Autonomy: Leading → Defining  
**Distinguished** - Impact: Organization → Ecosystem | Autonomy: Defining  
**Fellow** - Impact: Ecosystem | Autonomy: Defining

### Management Level
**Lead / Coordinator** - Impact: Team | Autonomy: Leading  
**Manager** - Impact: Department | Autonomy: Leading  
**Head / Director** - Impact: Organization | Autonomy: Defining  
**VP** - Impact: Organization | Autonomy: Defining

### Executive Level
**C-Level** - Impact: Organization → Ecosystem | Autonomy: Defining
