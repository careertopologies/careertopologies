Competencies represent the skills and capabilities that professionals develop throughout their careers. In the Career Topologies framework, we organize these competencies into **6 progression pillars**, each with a proficiency scale from 1 to 5.

## The 6 Progression Pillars

### 1. Technical
Mastery of specific technical skills in your area of expertise.

### 2. Problem Solving
Ability to identify, analyze, and solve problems effectively.

### 3. Communication
Skill to convey ideas clearly, persuasively, and appropriately to context and audience.

### 4. Leadership
Ability to influence, inspire, and guide people and teams toward common goals.

### 5. Delivery
Capacity to transform ideas into concrete and measurable results.

### 6. Learning
Ability to acquire new knowledge, adapt to changes, and promote continuous growth.

## Proficiency Levels

Each pillar is assessed on a 1-5 scale:

- **Level 1 - Developing**: Learning fundamentals, executes simple tasks with guidance
- **Level 2 - Proficient**: Masters fundamentals, works independently on standard tasks
- **Level 3 - Expert**: Advanced mastery, solves complex problems, team reference
- **Level 4 - Master**: Recognized authority, defines standards, innovates practices
- **Level 5 - Thought Leader**: External reference, contributes to discipline evolution

## Competency Mapping by Level
