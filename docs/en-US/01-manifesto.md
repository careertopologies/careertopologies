# Career Manifesto

[![Back](https://img.shields.io/badge/BACK-documentation-blue?style=for-the-badge)](./README.md)

Developing a solid career within an organization is a complex challenge. While each person should be responsible for their own trajectory, companies have a duty to be transparent about available opportunities and expectations associated with each role. This manifesto seeks to establish clear principles that promote a fair and guided growth environment.

## The Pillars

With the goal of guiding the framework, I developed this manifesto with 8 pillars:

## 1. Transparency

Growth opportunities must be **clearly accessible to everyone**, with well-defined expectations for each role and level of responsibility.

## 2. Merit

Promotions and recognition must be **grounded in tangible results**, avoiding favoritism. The company must promote an environment where everyone has the necessary tools to thrive, respecting diversity.

## 3. Equality

**Equal conditions** must be ensured in terms of salary, benefits, and treatment for all people in the same position, regardless of their differences.

## 4. Consistency

Recognition and promotions should value **consistent delivery**, prioritizing sustainable long-term growth rather than one-time achievements.

## 5. Cooperation

Career development should not be seen as a competition. **Fostering collaboration** helps reduce anxiety and rivalries, strengthening collective success.

## 6. Diversity

The company must create an environment that **promotes inclusion and development of diverse groups**, especially in leadership positions and at all organizational levels.

## 7. Ownership

Career development is a **shared responsibility**. While the company provides support, each person must chart their own path, defining goals and making decisions that drive their growth.

## 8. Flexibility

The organization must allow **movement between different areas and specialties**, promoting horizontal and vertical transitions, and encouraging development in leadership or specialization according to individual aspirations.
