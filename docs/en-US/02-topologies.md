## What are Career Topologies?

In the context of this framework, the term "topology" describes the fundamental structure of career paths within an organization. Often referred to as a "ladder" or "track", topology defines:

- **Possible paths** for professional growth
- **Allowed transitions** between different roles
- **Progression structure** throughout the career
- **Flexibility** for direction changes

Topology is the most important structural decision when implementing a career framework, as it determines how professionals can evolve and develop within the organization.

### Why Does Topology Matter?

The choice of topology directly impacts:

- **Career clarity**: Professionals understand their possible paths
- **Talent retention**: ICs can grow without needing to become managers
- **Organizational flexibility**: Allows role experimentation
- **Company culture**: Reflects values about leadership and specialization

### One Topology or Hybrid Approaches?

There is no single rule. Some organizations:
- Adopt **one topology** for the entire company (simplicity)
- Use **different topologies** by area (e.g., Y for sales, W for engineering)
- Implement **hybrid models** (Y with temporary Network-style rotations)

The choice depends on the organization's size, culture, and maturity stage.

## Y-Model Topology

The Y-Model is the most traditional and widely adopted structure. It offers two distinct paths after a fork point in the career.

</div>

### Description

- **Single track early on**: Entry → Junior → Mid-level (linear progression)
- **Fork at mid-level**: Professional chooses between two tracks
  - **Management Track**: Manager → Senior Manager → Director → VP
  - **Individual Contributor (IC) Track**: Senior IC → Staff → Principal → Distinguished
- **Parallel progression**: Both tracks advance in parallel after the fork
- **Limited transitions**: Movement between tracks is rare or complex

### Best For

- Traditional and hierarchical organizations
- Companies that value clear separation between management and technical roles
- Stable and predictable organizational structures
- Regulated sectors or established corporations

### Pros

**Simplicity**: Easy to understand and communicate at all levels  
**Clarity**: Well-defined expectations for each track  
**Widely recognized**: Industry standard, facilitates recruitment  
**Scalable**: Works well in large organizations

### Cons

**Inflexibility**: Difficult to reverse the choice after the fork  
**Pressure to manage**: Professionals may feel they need to become managers to progress  
**Perceived ceiling**: ICs may feel their growth is limited  
**Lack of experimentation**: Doesn't allow temporarily testing management

### Progression Example

```
Entry Level → Junior → Mid-level
                        ↓
                    [FORK]
                   /          \
        [Management]            [Technical IC]
          ↓                           ↓
       Manager                   Senior IC
          ↓                           ↓
    Senior Manager                 Staff
          ↓                           ↓
      Director                   Principal
          ↓                           ↓
         VP                     Distinguished
```

## W-Model Topology

The W-Model expands Y's flexibility by adding a third track and allowing bidirectional transitions between paths.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../assets/careertopologies-model-w.png" alt="W-Model" width="600">
</div>

### Description

- **Three parallel tracks**:
  - **Individual Contributor (IC)**: Focus on deep technical expertise
  - **People Management**: Team leadership with people responsibility
  - **Technical Leadership**: Technical leadership without direct management (Tech Lead, Architect, Staff Engineer)
- **Bidirectional transitions**: Professionals can move between tracks
- **Shared early levels**: Entry → Junior → Mid (common to all)
- **Multiple "forks"**: More than one choice point throughout the career

### Technical Leadership Role

The third track (Technical Leadership) is the W-Model differentiator:
- **Deep technical expertise** + **organizational influence**
- **No direct people management** (no 1:1s, performance reviews)
- **Technical mentorship** and standards/architecture definition
- **Bridge** between ICs and managers

### Best For

- Growing technology companies
- Organizations valuing technical depth AND leadership
- Cultures supporting role experimentation
- Sectors with rapid technological evolution

### Pros

**Career flexibility**: Allows experimenting with management without permanent commitment  
**Values technical leadership**: Recognizes that leadership ≠ people management  
**IC↔Manager transitions**: Professionals can test management and return to IC  
**Reduces management pressure**: ICs have leadership path without becoming managers

### Cons

**Complexity**: Harder to explain and implement than Y-Model  
**Requires organizational maturity**: Culture must support transitions  
**Tech Lead role needs clear definition**: Clarity about scope and expectations  
**Risk of confusion**: If poorly implemented, can generate role ambiguity

### Progression Example

```
Entry Level → Junior → Mid-level
                        ↓
              [MULTIPLE CHOICES]
              /        |        \
    [Management]  [Tech Lead]     [IC]
       ↓              ↓             ↓
    Manager      Tech Manager   Senior IC
       ↓              ↓             ↓
 Sr Manager    Sr Tech Manager   Staff
       ↓              ↓             ↓
  Director    Principal Eng    Principal
       
  [Bidirectional transitions allowed between tracks]
```

## Network Model Topology

The Network Model is the most fluid and adaptable approach, without predefined fixed tracks. Career is built through projects, skills, and organizational needs.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../assets/careertopologies-model-n.png" alt="Network Model" width="600">
</div>

### Description

- **No fixed tracks**: Career doesn't follow a linear or predefined path
- **Project and skill-based**: Progression linked to deliveries and competencies
- **Fluid transitions**: Free movement between different roles as needed
- **Hybrid roles**: Professionals can combine IC, leadership, and management aspects
- **Organic growth**: Career evolves naturally with contributions and impact

### How It Works

In the Network Model:
- **Roles defined by current needs**, not rigid structure
- **Professionals build skill portfolio** instead of climbing linear ladder
- **Progression measured by impact**, not time or hierarchical position
- **Small organizations or agile teams** reorganize frequently
- **Autonomy is fundamental**: Professionals shape their own paths

### Best For

- Startups and innovative companies with flat structures
- Consultancies and agencies with project-based work
- Organizations embracing ambiguity and autonomy
- Experimental and high-trust cultures
- Small and multidisciplinary teams

### Pros

**Maximum flexibility**: Adapts quickly to organizational changes  
**Empowers individuals**: Professionals shape their own careers  
**Promotes versatility**: Encourages diverse skill development  
**Organizational agility**: Structure responds fluidly to needs

### Cons

**Lack of clarity**: Can be confusing and create anxiety about progression  
**Requires high maturity**: Both organizational and individual  
**Difficult to scale**: Complex to maintain consistency in large organizations  
**Risk of perceived inequity**: Without clear criteria, progression may seem arbitrary  
**High communication demand**: Requires constant alignment

### Progression Example

```
No linear progression. Example trajectories:

Person A:
  Junior Engineer → Project Lead (Project X) → 
  Product Engineer (Product Y) → Tech Lead (Squad Z)

Person B:
  Designer → UX Researcher (Project A) → 
  Product Designer + Facilitator (Initiative B) → 
  Design Lead (Area C)

[Movements based on skills, projects, and impact]

## Which Topology Should You Choose?

The right topology choice depends on several organizational factors:

### By Organization Size

**Small (< 50 people)**
- **Recommendation**: Network or W Model
- **Reason**: Flexibility is more important than rigid structure

**Medium (50-500 people)**
- **Recommendation**: W Model
- **Reason**: Balance between clarity and flexibility

**Large (> 500 people)**
- **Recommendation**: Y or W Model
- **Reason**: Need for clarity and consistency at scale

### By Growth Stage

**Startup (Early Stage)**
- **Recommendation**: Network Model
- **Reason**: Maximum agility and adaptation

**Scale-up (Growth)**
- **Recommendation**: W Model
- **Reason**: Sufficient structure without excessive rigidity

**Mature Company**
- **Recommendation**: Y or W Model
- **Reason**: Predictability and established processes

### By Organizational Culture

**Traditional/Hierarchical**
- **Recommendation**: Y Model
- **Reason**: Alignment with command-and-control values

**Innovative/Collaborative**
- **Recommendation**: W Model
- **Reason**: Values technical specialization and leadership

**Experimental/Autonomous**
- **Recommendation**: Network Model
- **Reason**: Empowers individuals and promotes autonomy

### By Industry

**Enterprise Software, Finance**
- **Recommendation**: Y or W Model

**Tech Companies, Digital Products**
- **Recommendation**: W Model

**Agencies, Consultancies, Startups**
- **Recommendation**: Network or W Model

### General Recommendation

**Start with Y or W.** The Network Model requires high organizational maturity and can create confusion if not well implemented. For most organizations:

1. **Y Model**: If prioritizing clarity and simplicity
2. **W Model**: If valuing flexibility and technical depth
3. **Network Model**: Only if culture already operates with high autonomy and trust

## Hybrid and Custom Topologies

There's no obligation to choose just one model for the entire organization.

### Hybrid Examples

**Hybrid 1: Y + Network**
- Y Model for most roles
- Network Model for innovation teams or labs
- **Advantage**: General clarity with flexibility where needed

**Hybrid 2: W + Temporary Rotations**
- W Model as base structure
- Temporary rotations in other teams (Network-inspired)
- **Advantage**: Clear structure + experimentation opportunities

**Hybrid 3: Y with Tech Lead Track**
- Traditional Y Model
- Adds Tech Lead track between IC and Management (approaching W)
- **Advantage**: Incremental evolution from Y to W

### Beware of Excessive Complexity

Hybrids can work, but:
- **Avoid too many variations**: Reduces clarity
- **Document differences well**: Transparency is fundamental
- **Review periodically**: Adjust as organization evolves
