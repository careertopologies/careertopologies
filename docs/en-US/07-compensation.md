Compensation and recognition are fundamental elements to ensure fairness, transparency, and sustainability of career tracks. This document establishes principles and practices for structuring compensation aligned with Career Topologies framework values.

## Compensation Principles

### 1. Internal Equity
**Same position, same salary band**, regardless of gender, race, orientation, or other personal characteristics.

### 2. Transparency
Salary ranges should be **clear and accessible** to all professionals.

### 3. Market Competitiveness
Compensation should be **competitive** to attract and retain talent.

### 4. Merit-Based on Impact
Recognition should reflect **tangible results and demonstrated impact**.

## Salary Band Structure

Each level has a **salary band** with:
- **Minimum**: Band floor (usually for newly promoted professionals)
- **Midpoint**: Band center (full proficiency at level)
- **Maximum**: Band ceiling (consistent exceptional performance)

### Example Structure

```
Entry Level: $40K - $60K
Junior: $60K - $90K
Mid-Level: $90K - $130K
Senior: $130K - $190K
Staff/Lead: $190K - $280K
Principal/Manager: $280K - $400K
Distinguished/Director: $400K - $600K
VP: $600K - $900K
C-Level: $900K+
```

*Note: Example values. Must be adjusted according to market, region, and company context.*
